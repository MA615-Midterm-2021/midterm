## Introduction:
In this Midtern project, our group want to explore the pesticide usage situation of straberries in Florida, Washington, New York State, California,
North Carolina, and Oregon. There are mainly three parts of this projects: initial EDA, illustration of data using shiny, and final conclusion. The
data set contain data from four different years, since most observations come from 2019 and 2016, we decide to only focus on those two years.  

## Data set:
The three data sets we use are the USDA strawberry data set, the insectisides data set, and the herbicides-hungicide-other data set.

## Two Main questions we want to ask and answer:
1. What is the pesticide usage in planting straberries in each state? which one is prefered and what is the organic proportion in each state in 2019 and 2016?
2. Which kind of toxicity is potentially more possible to encounter in each state in 2019 and 2016?

## EDA:
### The two images below indicate the Organic Proprotion of each state in 2016 and 2019.

### Since there are two measurement scales: in dollar$ and in CWT score, We show the organice value in two measurment scales seperately.
The two images below indicate the Organic Value (measure in dollar, unit is 1000$) of each state in 2016 and 2019.

### The two images below indicate the Organic Value (measure in CWT) of each state in 2016 and 2019.

### Then we explored the usage of different kinds of pesticide in each state in 2016 and 2019.

### At last, we explore the toxicities each state is possible to encounter in 2019 and 2016:

## Shiny:
We build a simple shiny interface here:

## Final Conclusion:
1. bla bla bla

2. bla bla bla

3. bla bla bla
